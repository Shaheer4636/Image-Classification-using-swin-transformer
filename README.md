## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the Swin Transformer model, a powerful deep learning model, for the task of image classification. The Swin Transformer represents a shift from traditional convolutional neural networks to transformer-based architectures in image recognition tasks.

## Project Setup and Implementation
- **Library Import**: The project begins with the import of essential libraries including TensorFlow, Torch, torchvision, PIL for image processing, and timm for accessing pre-trained models.
- **Image Downloading**: An example image is downloaded for inference. This serves as the input for the Swin Transformer model to perform classification.
- **Installing `timm`**: The `timm` library (torchvision image models) is installed to access various pre-trained models, specifically the Swin Transformer variants.

## Swin Transformer Model
- **Model Selection**: The project lists all available Swin Transformer models pre-trained on ImageNet, allowing the selection of an appropriate model variant.
- **Swin Transformer Variants**: The variants include different sizes (tiny, small, base, large) and configurations (patch size, window size, resolution) of the Swin Transformer model.
- **Inference Setup**: The selected Swin Transformer model is loaded, and the downloaded image is processed and fed into the model for classification.
- **Class Prediction**: The model predicts the class of the image, showcasing the effectiveness of transformer models in image classification tasks.

## Conclusion
This project exemplifies the application of the Swin Transformer, a state-of-the-art transformer model, in image classification. It demonstrates the setup, model selection, and inference process using the `timm` library in a Python environment.
